# Changelog

All notable changes to print-md are documented here.
This project follows [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/).

## [0.5.1] - 2026-06-15

### Added

- **Transparent background sync.** When a project is connected to an online
  repository, print-md now keeps it in sync automatically — pulling teammates'
  changes shortly after you open it and periodically while you work, and sending
  yours up — with no buttons to press. The only thing you see is a small status
  ("Saving changes…" / "Everything is in sync"). You're prompted **only** when
  the same file changed in two places, with plain-language choices: **Keep my
  version**, **Use the online version**, or **Keep both** (the safe, lossless
  default). Auto-sync defaults on for connected projects; a Settings toggle can
  pause it.

### Changed

- **A project is its git repo.** Opening a folder — the repo root or any
  subfolder — now syncs the whole repository (plain Git), removing the previous
  per-book scoping that made the two behave differently.
- The separate manual Sync dialog and the History-tab Pull/Push controls were
  removed in favour of the transparent flow above.
- Substantial internal simplification: the sync engine now decides direction
  with a single merge-base check, and ~2,700 lines of dead/over-engineered sync
  and preview code were removed (behaviour unchanged).

### Fixed

- Auto-sync now pulls promptly when you open a project (previously it could wait
  several minutes).
- The deep-history "phantom New changes online" badge is gone.
- The primary accent colour now meets WCAG AA contrast against white text.
- Windows cross-chapter follow-highlight in the preview.

## [0.5.0] - 2026-06-11

### Added

- **Remote Git, for non-technical writers.** Connect a project to GitHub with a
  one-time device-flow sign-in (OAuth App — every repo you can access is
  visible, no per-repo install). Clone a project, and a book that lives inside a
  larger repo uses that repo's history and sync (multi-book picker included).
- **Workspace UI.** A tabbed left-panel sidebar (Table of Contents, Files,
  Media, Projects, History), an editor toolbar with markdown actions + image
  insert, a Media panel to browse/import/inspect project images, and a Problems
  panel that surfaces lint results in the app.

### Changed

- Sync was rebuilt fetch-first with distinct Pull and Push; "check for updates"
  is now refs-only (no history walk), so it stays fast on large repositories.

### Fixed

- Numerous viewer UX and sync-robustness fixes (responsive toolbar, themed
  scrollbars, render-overlay scoping, full-speed initial render, and more).

## [0.2.1] - 2026-06-04

### Added

- **Viewer: web-UI auto-update.** The desktop viewer now updates its SvelteKit
  UI bundle automatically from GitHub Releases (a separate `web-v*` release
  line, independent of the installer `v*` line). Updates are verified with an
  Ed25519-signed manifest and SHA-256 bundle integrity, downloaded and staged
  in the background, applied via an in-app **"Update ready / Apply now"** banner
  (or on next launch), and protected by a health-gate watchdog that rolls back
  a bundle that fails to boot. A manual **"Check for updates"** control is in
  the toolbar. The Electron shell and the library continue to update via a
  normal installer download.
- **Viewer: System info** now reports the Web UI bundle version alongside the
  Electron shell ("Viewer") version — they can differ after a web-UI update.

### Fixed

- **Viewer: System info** now resolves the library version (previously shown as
  `unknown`).
- **Viewer:** the "You're up to date" notification no longer appears twice on a
  manual check, and no longer fires at all on the silent background launch check
  (it only surfaces a banner when an update is actually staged).

## [0.2.0] - 2026-06-04

- Viewer workflow improvements: static-SPA (`adapter-static`) + `app://`
  architecture with IPC instead of HTTP routes, and PDF export via Electron's
  bundled Chromium. See the v0.2.0 release notes for details.
