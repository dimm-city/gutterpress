# Changelog

All notable changes to print-md are documented here.
This project follows [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/).

## [0.2.1] - 2026-06-04

### Added

- **Viewer: web-UI auto-update.** The desktop viewer now updates its SvelteKit
  UI bundle automatically from GitHub Releases (a separate `web-v*` release
  line, independent of the installer `v*` line). Updates are verified with an
  Ed25519-signed manifest and SHA-256 bundle integrity, downloaded and staged
  in the background, applied via an in-app **"Update ready / Apply now"** banner
  (or on next launch), and protected by a health-gate watchdog that rolls back
  a bundle that fails to boot. A manual **"Check for updates"** control is in
  the toolbar. The Electron shell and the library continue to update via a
  normal installer download. See [ADR 0003](docs/adr/0003-web-ui-auto-update.md).
- **Viewer: System info** now reports the Web UI bundle version alongside the
  Electron shell ("Viewer") version — they can differ after a web-UI update.

### Fixed

- **Viewer: System info** now resolves the library version (previously shown as
  `unknown`).
- **Viewer:** the "You're up to date" notification no longer appears twice on a
  manual check, and no longer fires at all on the silent background launch check
  (it only surfaces a banner when an update is actually staged).

## [0.2.0] - 2026-06-04

- Viewer workflow improvements: static-SPA (`adapter-static`) + `app://`
  architecture with IPC instead of HTTP routes, and PDF export via Electron's
  bundled Chromium. See the v0.2.0 release notes for details.
